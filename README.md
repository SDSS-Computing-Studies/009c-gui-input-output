Heron's method is a way of calculating the area of a triangle if all 
3 sides are known but you don't know the height of the triangle.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula#Formulation

The formula is A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)s-c))
where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle, and s is given by:
